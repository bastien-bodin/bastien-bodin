## Hi there 👋

I'm Bastien - I'm a PhD Candidate finishing a thesis on **computational physics**. I'm interested in developing new codes to continue "playing" with physics ⚛️ on a computer 💻. I like to couple physics stuff together and see their interactions occuring in "live". Currently, I am finishing my model *CryoPy*, designed for modeling cryolava flows🧊 on Europa and Titan, two icy moons of the Solar System 🪐.
